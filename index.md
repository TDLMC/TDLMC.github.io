# [](#Introduction)Project Introduction

We presented the time delay lens modeling challenge. The structure of the challenge is as follows. The “Evil” Team pro- duced a set of mock lenses, meant to mimic state of the art data quality. Anyone in the community is invited to partici- pate as a “Good” Team, by modeling the data and submitting a blind estimate of the Hubble Constant. The “Evil” Team will compute four metrics aimed at quantifying the accuracy

## [](#Rung-0)Rung-0

> Rung0 is a training exercise which consists of two lensed systems, one two-image (double) and one four-image (quad)configuration. The goal of this rung is to ensure that “Good” Team members understand the format of the data and that no bug/mistake could potentially false the results of the challenge for a specific method.

## [](#Rung-1)Rung-1

> This rung is meant to be the easiest one of the ladder. Thus, the mocks in Rung1 are generated in a similar way as in Rung0, except that we use a more realistic surface brightness distribution for the lensed AGN host and the time delays are affected by external convergence.

## [](#Rung-2)Rung-2

> Rung2 is meant to test PSF reconstruction features of lensing codes, in addition to the aspects tested in Rung1. For this purpose, we only provide a guess of the PSF but not the one actually used to generate the data.

## [](#Rung-3)Rung-3

> Rung3 is the highest level in this challenge, and thus the simulations are intended to be the most realistic. In addition to all the complexity we have adopted for Rung1 and Rung2, the observables are generated using massive early-type galaxies selected from numerical cosmological simulations.
