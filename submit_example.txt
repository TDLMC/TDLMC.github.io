# Submissions must follow the format and naming convention. Each team can
# submit multiple entries if they have different algorithms or different estimators
# (e.g. maximum likelihood vs median posterior). Please make sure the
# name of the file is unique. The name of the file must be: "teamname_algorithmZ.h0"
#
# Please include in the header of the file the names of all the team members,
# and their institutional affiliations and emails.
# That way we can make sure everyone is in the loop
# when we send feedback and make announcements.
# 
# You should submit your actual results in a text file like the one below,
# following these guidelines:
#   * Point estimate of H0 and its 68% uncertainty should be given in km/s/Mpc.
#   * Uncertainties will be interpreted as Gaussian: do your best to approximate it.
#   * If you tried to infer the H0 for one sample but could not (ie because
#      you consider your errors to be too large, or not well enough 
#      characterized), please give both the dt and the dterr as -99 so we can
#      register it as a rejection. It's very important that you report an 
#      estimate or a -99 flag for every sample you analyze, not just the
#      ones where you were successful.
#   * Some of the metrics depend on the number of systems analyzed.
#      It is up to each team to decide how many systems to analyze.
#      However, you should only submit H0 and H0err
#      values for the systems you analyze, removing the ones you did not 
#      attempt. (This is why the -99 values for failed attempts are
#      important.)
#   * rung?_overall is the best estimate of H0 for each rung.
#     You are allowed to use any algorithm to evaluate it,
#     including rejection of outliers, etc.
# Please email your submission to the TDC Evil Team at:
