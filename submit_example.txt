# We recommend you follow the format "teamname_algorithmZ.h0"
# and submit one file of the challenge. You can submit multiple
# entries, so should include version numbers in your algorithm names as you
# like. 
# 
# Please include in this header the names of all your team members, and their
# institutional affiliations. That way we can make sure everyone is in the loop
# when we send feedback and make announcements.
# 
# You should submit your actual results in a table like the one below,
# following these guidelines:
#   * H0 and its 68% uncertainty should be given in km/s/Mpc.
#   * Uncertainties will be interpreted as Gaussian: do your best.
#   * If you tried to infer the H0 for one sample but could not (ie because
#      you consider your errors to be too large, or not well enough 
#      characterised), please give both the dt and the dterr as -99 so we can
#      register it as a rejection. It's very important that you report an 
#      estimate or a -99 flag for every sample you analyze, not just the
#      ones where you were successful.
#   * Some of the metrics we use depend on the number of samples estimated - 
#       please do as many as you can! You should only submit H0 and H0err
#       values for the files you analyze, removing the ones you did not 
#       attempt. (This is why the -99 values for failed attempts are
#       important.)
